# insurance-cost-prediction
In this project, I built a multiple linear regression model in Python to predict insurance costs based on a dataset of 1,338 individuals. The dataset included variables like age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. I cleaned and explored the data, then trained the model to understand how these factors impact insurance charges.

The model performed well, reaching about 75% accuracy. I also visualized the results using matplotlib to better understand the relationship between actual vs predicted values. This project gave me hands-on experience with regression modeling, feature selection, and performance evaluation in a real-world dataset.
